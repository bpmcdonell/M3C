Module 3 Challenge: GW Coding Bootcamp

## Description
This site was built for my third week homework challenge for GW's coding bootcamp. The goal of this weeks assignment was to create the javascript necessary for a password generator that asks you for perameters of the given password and then placing them within the HTML of the website using DOM manipulation. 

## Installation

## Features
This site features the use of javascript logic, error validaiton, functions, for loops, objects, event listeners, and DOM manipulation. 

## Tests
This site features tests for some failiure states that can occur when attempting to generate a password, such as; selecting a length for the password that is too short (password < 8 or password > 128) and not selecting any of the character types for the password. Those failure states and the subsequent alerts to retry are shown in the screenshots below.
